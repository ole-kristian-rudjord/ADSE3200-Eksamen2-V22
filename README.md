# ES-file-placeholder

## What is project ES?
ES is a project I have wanted to work on for a long time. As soon as I started learning JavaScript, JQuery, and some basics of Spring Boot, I have finally been able to start working on this project. The project might be a niche website as it is based around gaming mice, which is something I am quite interested in.

## About
ES is currently under development and, as of now, features two pages. 
"Compare Shapes" will be the main page, letting users compare different gaming mice based on their shape and specifications. 
"Search Mouse" will display the full database of mice, letting users search for and filter mice based on specifications they are looking for. 
"Find Similar Shape" has not yet been implemented but will feature a tool for automatically finding similar shapes to selected mice.

## Still under development
Because the website is still in early development, some bugs, errors, and poor optimization might be expected from certain features while testing new implementations and updates. 
Since the main focus has been on the website so far, few mice have been added to the current database. Once launched, I will have implemented a feature to help expand the database through, what I hope, will be a community wanting to add more mice and shapes over time as new products arise.

## Tool/technologies
The website is hosted on Heroku.
The front-end is built on standard HTML+CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
The back-end is currently using Spring Boot with a placeholder H2 database which will be replaced by a hosted MySQL database.
