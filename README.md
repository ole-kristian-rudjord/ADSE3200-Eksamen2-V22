ES(current project name) is a personal project I am working on, the name will change as I publish the website in the future.

## About
ES will be a website used for comparing gaming mice based on their spesifications and shape.
The main page (Compare Shapes) will feature a shape comparrison tool.
Two more pages will be added in the future. 
The "Search Mouse" page will display the entire mouse database letting users search and filter for specific mice or specifications. 
The "Find Similar Shape" will show similar shapes based on users selected mice.

## Updates
Because the website is in such early development, bugs, errors and poor optimization is expected. 
Once the main front-end parts of the main page is done and I have more experience with Spring and SQL, I will move on to the back-end.
